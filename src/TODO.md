# TODO LIST:
# HIGH PRIORITY
- Further server mixin testing
- Make wintergreen wood non-flammable (like a nether wood)

# MEDIUM PRIORITY
   # COMPAT

   Fix gratuitous error logs generated from running the game with resources
that are not used when someone doesn't have every mod we do model compat for
   (something to do with data-packs if I were to guess, 
     but I don't want to break datagen so I should try just some sort of error supression)
